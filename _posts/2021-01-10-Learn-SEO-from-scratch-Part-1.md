## What is SEO

### Search engine optimization (SEO)

Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic (known as "natural" or "organic" results) rather than direct traffic or paid traffic. Unpaid traffic may originate from different kinds of searches, including image search, video search, academic search, news search, and industry-specific vertical search engines.

### Search engine marketing (SEM)

 Search engine marketing (SEM) is a form of Internet marketing that involves the promotion of websites by increasing their visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs) primarily through paid advertising. SEM may incorporate search engine optimization (SEO), which adjusts or rewrites website content and site architecture to achieve a higher ranking in search engine results pages to enhance pay per click (PPC) listings.

* TDK: Title, Description and Keyword
* Link
  * Internal link: Internal links are hyperlinks that direct the reader to a target page on your website
  * External link: External links point from one domain to an entirely separate domain. 
  * Link exchange
* Impression: An impression is counted when a list item is visible in the short list view, and also when the list view is expanded, whether or not the item is actually scrolled into view. Therefore, if an item is visible in the short view and the user then clicks to expand the list, two impressions are counted.
* CPC: Cost Per Click. CPC refers to the cost an advertiser pays each time an online user clicks on his or her digital ad. This value is determined by dividing the cost of the marketing campaign by the total number of clicks. In PPC campaigns, advertisers can lower their CPC by using smart bidding strategies, and by improving the quality of their ads and landing pages.
* CPM: Cost Per Thousand. This term refers to the cost for every 1,000 impressions (or views) of an ad. The CPM advertising model is typically used for marketing campaigns that are focused on building brand awareness, such as banner ad campaigns.
* Organic Search: When people search for things and get back the results, the top few are likely to be paid or “sponsored” listings. But everything else – that’s organic search.
* Paid Search: Paid ad placements within search engines are referred to, quite appropriately, as paid search.
* SERPs: search engine results pages. This is the page of a search engine like Google or Bing that features the results of a search query. For example, if an online user searches “what is Internet marketing,” the SERP shows the results that the search engine has found to be the most user-friendly and helpful in answering this question. The SERP features both paid and organic (unpaid) results. SEO can be used to improve a website’s organic rankings on SERPs.
* PPC: This stands for pay per click, which is a model of search engine advertising in which you only pay when customers actually click, as opposed to paying for impressions.
